Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

Matplotlib graphs your data on Figures (e.g., windows, Jupyter widgets, etc.), each of which can contain one or more Axes,
 an area where points can be specified in terms of x-y coordinates (or theta-r in a polar plot, x-y-z in a 3D plot, etc.).
 The simplest way of creating a Figure with an Axes is using pyplot.subplots.
 We can then use Axes.plot to draw some data on the Axes:


 fig, ax = plt.subplots()  # Create a figure containing a single axes.
ax.plot([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 4, 2, 3])  # Plot some data on the axes.
plt.show()
